# Vector Map

[![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@refactors/vector-map.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@refactors/vector-map)

This library is originally based on [jVectorMap](http://jvectormap.com/), a jQuery vector map plugin. Since it hasn't been updated in the last two years and couldn't be easily used with NodeJS, we decided to fork it and clean its code and make it available to everyone through `npm`.
